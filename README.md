# 🎨 Background Color Changer

A fun and educational project that changes the background color of the page using JavaScript — implemented using **three different methods**, each more efficient than the last!

---

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Basic DOM manipulation
- Adding event listeners
- Optimizing with event delegation (event bubbling)

Click on any color button and the background of the page will change to that color!

---

## 🚀 Approaches

### ✅ 1. Basic Method

Manually attach an event listener to **each button individually**.


### ✅ 2. Medium Method — Using forEach()

Select all buttons using querySelectorAll() and loop through them.


### ✅ 3. Optimized Method — Using Event Bubbling

Attach a single event listener to the parent container and handle all button clicks using event.target.



## 🧠 Concepts Used

addEventListener()

event.target

classList.contains()

querySelectorAll()

forEach()

Event Bubbling & Delegation
